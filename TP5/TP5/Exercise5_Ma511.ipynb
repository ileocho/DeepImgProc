You will be using a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) As you saw in class it corresponds to a GAN where the generator and discriminator are deep convolutional networks. \n","\n","You will implement the following methods:\n","- A generator network that maps vectors of shape (latent_dim,) to images of shape (32, 32, 3).\n","- A discriminator network that maps images of shape (32, 32, 3) to a score that describes how real the image looks.\n","- A GAN that combines the generator and the discriminator : GAN(x) = discriminator(generator(x)).\n","- We train the discriminator using examples of real and fake images along with \"real\"/\"fake\" labels, as we would train any regular image classification model.\n","- As discussed in class, we train the generator to fool the discriminator.\n","\n","\n","The GAN will be trained on images from CIFAR10. CIFAR10 is a dataset of 50,000 32x32 RGB images belonging to 10 classes (5,000 images per class). In this exercise you will only deal with the class \"frog\".\n","\n","### Training tricks\n","\n","Here are a few of the tricks that will help you train the GANs.\n","\n","- We use tanh as the last activation in the generator.\n","\n","- Sample points from the latent space using a normal distribution.\n","\n","- Introducing randomness during training helps prevent geting \"stuck\". We will use dropout in the discriminator and  add some random noise to the labels for the discriminator.\n","\n","- Instead of max pooling, you will be using strided convolutions for downsampling, and LeakyReLU activation. \n","\n","##  The Generator Network\n","\n","First, we create the generator network, which transforms a vector into a candidate image. One of the many problems that may arise with GANs training is that the generator gets stuck with images that look like noise. You should try to use dropout on both the discriminator and generator."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"id":"qPafXFe7-cqO"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Model:
